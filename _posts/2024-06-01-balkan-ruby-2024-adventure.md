**Intro**

When I saw the announcement for the  Balkan Ruby conference, it immediately brought back memories of
the 2019 Balkan Ruby conference which was also held in Sofia. I was so excited and decided to buy
tickets without delay. Previous experience had shown me that attending  a conference is better with
friends so I started to look around for some people to join me. I managed to get a close friend to
agree to accompany me on this adventure. In addition, we also wanted to organize a gathering of our
Ruby Turkiye community, the more the merrier. üôÇ

**The Train Trip**

I have always wanted to travel on a sleeper train. I remember watching YouTube videos about
different sleeper trains in various parts of the world, they all looked exciting. Luckily for me
there was a sleeper train available, the aptly named, Sofia Express, which travels from Istanbul to
Sofia, passing through the neighboring city of Edirne. It was the most obvious and perfect way to
get to our destination. The trip proved to be quite comfortable, despite it not being a match for
one of those luxury sleeper trains in Japan, but it was good  enough for us and we really enjoyed
the 2 berth compartment or ‚Äúcoupe‚Äù as they are sometimes called. We got on the train at midnight,
enjoyed the night view, watched a movie into the late hours, and finally rested until morning. We
got off the train after a refreshing sleep and now were ready for the morning coffee in Sofia.

**Vitosha & Sofia**

I like green cities, and Sofia never fails to disappoint, with its beautiful nature. The conference
venue was conveniently situated near our hotel in the Vitosha neighborhood. The scenic view of a
misty Vitosha mountain shrouded by a cloudy sky greeted us when we arrived. After resting a bit, we
took a stroll through one of the beautiful parks passing by a bubbling creek the sound of which
added to the calming ambience, finally the path led us directly to Sofia's city center. Here we
found some interesting historical architecture and plenty of shops and cafes.

**The Conference Spirit**

The conference opening speeches and first day events are always exciting and fun. Whenever I go to a
conference, those few hours on the first mornings are the time I spend looking around to spot
friends, meet new people and strike up a conversation whilst waiting in line for coffee. Witnessing
in person, the excitement and enthusiasm in people‚Äôs faces, is energizing. One of my favorite
moments of the conference was meeting [Xavier Nova](https://hashref.com/), who is the author of the
famous coding  [Zeitwerk library](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk). Listening to his story of how he
came up with the name was fascinating. Another fun moment for me was to see the members of the  Ruby
Turkiye community. We did some brainstorming about how we could make the Ruby Turkiye community more
active and able to  contribute to the Ruby ecosystem. This in turn resulted in me giving a
presentation about "Neovim and Rails" in the official Ruby Turkiye virtual meetup.

I‚Äôm sure everyone agrees that the two most enjoyable things of any conference except for the talks
are the food and drink on offer. This conference didn‚Äôt disappoint me at all in this regard. The
Bulgarian **banitsa**, a feta pie, known as a borek in Turkey, and **boza**, a fermented wheat drink
were both delicious.

**The Talks**

‚Äú**Back to Business**‚Äù was the theme of this year‚Äôs conference so the talks were mostly about ¬†
business. In general, all the¬† talks were engaging but a couple in particular stood out for me.
[Aitor Garcia Rey‚Äôs ‚Äú**Running a Fintech with
Ruby**‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1vT3a5cQ8g&list=PLAkGYJoUfB0s1x8AcxBlnpnKFOPblEkRa&index=7)
was an¬† interesting examination of the complexities of digital payment systems. [Stephen Margheim‚Äôs
‚Äú**How (and why) to run SQLite in
production**‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMYfpU6_-s&list=PLAkGYJoUfB0s1x8AcxBlnpnKFOPblEkRa&index=1)
was clearly a trending topic in the Ruby & Rails environment. [Radoslav Stankov‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Engineer
Company with Ruby on
Rails‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUM4KIrsaQo&list=PLAkGYJoUfB0s1x8AcxBlnpnKFOPblEkRa&index=3)
was an¬† inspirational description of the solo trader and how they can succeed going it alone.
[Dimiter Petrov‚Äôs ‚Äú20 Years and Going: Making it as a
Consultancy‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XsrA-dXDGw&list=PLAkGYJoUfB0s1x8AcxBlnpnKFOPblEkRa&index=4)
highlighted how much the company [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/) has contributed to the Ruby
ecosystem, not least with the quality content they provided in their¬† [blog posts, podcasts
,books](https://thoughtbot.com/resources) and [open source
gems](https://thoughtbot.com/open-source). I‚Äôm in no doubt that every Ruby developer has benefited
from their resources. I have selected just a few of the very many excellent presentations, the rest
of which can be found on the [‚ÄúBalkan Ruby 2024‚Äù YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAkGYJoUfB0s1x8AcxBlnpnKFOPblEkRa) or alternatively
you can read about them on [their¬† website](https://balkanruby.com/2024).

**Final Thoughts**

For me, a conference is not just about the talks themselves, it is also so much more namely the
trip, the community, the friends, the inspiration, the memories, the jokes, the fun, the city, the
drinks, the food. It is a whole adventure. Of course, not all of them have to be perfect, but when
you truly get into the spirit it is impossible not to enjoy the whole adventure. In fact, this is
how I try to get the most out of a conference. Looking forward to the next one!
